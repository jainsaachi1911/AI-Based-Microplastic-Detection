# CLEANSE - AI  
**Classification and Environmental Analysis of Microplastics for a Sustainable Ecosystem using AI**

## Project Overview

CLEANSE-AI presents an end-to-end computer vision framework designed to detect and classify microplastics in microscopic water images. The solution leverages advanced data augmentation techniques, YOLOv8 for object detection, and a Random Forest classifier to assess pollution severity. This system aims to provide scalable, interpretable, and automated environmental monitoring.

## Methodology

1. **Data Augmentation**  
   Simulates real-world imaging conditions using:
   - Horizontal Flip (18.5%)
   - Gaussian Noise (18.5%)
   - Motion Blur (18.5%)
   - Lighting variations

2. **Microplastic Detection using YOLOv8**  
   - Detects individual particles with bounding boxes.
   - Outputs features like size and shape.

3. **Pollution Classification using Random Forest**  
   - Extracted features: count, size metrics, aspect ratio.
   - Predicts pollution level: Low, Moderate, High, or Critical.
